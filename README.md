### 👋 Hi, I'm Adoniyas 

I make things look good — on screen and on paper.

By day (and most nights), I'm a graphic designer and video editor. I also code. Still learning, still building, still figuring it out — but that's the fun part.

Right now I'm working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. Slow progress is still progress.

🎨 Tools I use: Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Figma, etc.
💻 Currently: learning frontend development, one project at a time
📁 What's here: design work, video edits, and things I've built
📫 Say hi: realadoniyas@gmail.com

✨ Creativity and code — that's the goal.
